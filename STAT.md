# Developer Learning Plan: FastAPI and Model Inference

## Objective
Your task is to implement a backend system that enables visually similar image search using FastAPI and integrates third-party models for image analysis. This hands-on project will provide experience in API development and model inference.

## Learning Goals
3. **FastAPI Backend API Development**  
   - Master backend API development with FastAPI, using "visually similar images" search as a practical example.

4. **Third-Party Model Inference**  
   - Gain experience integrating custom or open-source models for extracting patterns and objects from images.

---

## Task Instructions

### 1. **Set Up the Development Environment**
- Install and configure FastAPI.
- Set up necessary dependencies using `pip` or a `requirements.txt` file.
- Add FastAPI to the existing `docker-compose.yml` file to run the service along with Qdrant.

### 2. **Develop a FastAPI Backend for Similar Image Search**
- Implement a FastAPI backend that allows users to search for visually similar images.
- Set up an API endpoint that accepts an image and returns the most similar stored images.
- Use **Qdrant as a vector storage** to perform similarity searches.
- Ensure proper request handling, response formatting, and error handling in FastAPI.

### 3. **Integrate Third-Party Model Inference**
- Choose a pre-trained open-source or custom model for extracting patterns or objects from images.
- Integrate this model into your API to enhance image feature extraction.
- Implement an API endpoint that runs the model on an uploaded image and returns extracted features or object detections.

### 4. **Test and Validate the System**
- Use sample images to validate the visually similar image search functionality.
- Ensure that the inference model correctly extracts patterns and objects from images.
- Optimize API performance for scalability and response time.

### 5. **Acceptance Criteria**
- A fully functional FastAPI backend that provides:
  - An endpoint for visually similar image search using Qdrant as vector storage.
  - An endpoint for running model inference on images.
- FastAPI is included in `docker-compose.yml` alongside Qdrant.
- The ability to successfully process and analyze images using third-party models.
- Proper API documentation using OpenAPI (Swagger UI).
